## Getting Started

Here goes the instructions to get the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

To run this project You will need the following things installed on your machine

- NodeJS
- NPM
- Docker (Optional)

### Run with Docker

It's super simple. If you already have Docker installed and running on your machine you can just run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

It will give you 3 things

1. The Express server in development mode (With hot reloading support)
2. A PostgreSQL database server (If you prefer something else like MySQL just make a couple of change inside the `docker-compose.yaml` file) The credentials are

```sh
DB_HOST = database-layer;
DB_NAME = dbname;
DB_USER = dbuser;
DB_PASSWORD = dbpassword;
```

3. A Database investigation tool named `Adminer` (You can inspect any kind of database from the browser) You can access it from `http://localhost:8080`

If you want to change or update any code you can just make the change and from the console you will see that the server is getting updated.

### Run without docker

If you don't use Docker then you will get an exception specifying you don't have any database.
TO avoid that you can do 2 things.

1. First go inside the `.env.development` file and specify the following variables of a database server that you are using.

```
DB_HOST=database-layer
DB_NAME=dbname
DB_USER=dbuser
DB_PASSWORD=dbpassword
```

2. Otherwise go inside the `index.ts` file and on line number 29 comment of the following line

```js
dbClient = await connection.sync();
```

## Project Structure

If you want to add a new route then you will goto `/routes` folder and add a new Router.
Then register that router in the `index.ts` file under the `/routes` folder.

Then you will create a Controller under the `/controllers` directory.All business logics should go into there.

Specific use cases should be handles by Service classes under the `/service` folder.

All Database related things should go under `/repositories` folder.

To create a new model for data base look into the `/models` folder.
